# My first Fast API App

## Overview

The My first Fast API App is a RESTful application developed using **FastAPI** as part of the AI Bootcamp at PureLogics. The project demonstrates the fundamentals of backend API development by implementing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations while following a clean and modular project structure.

The application exposes REST endpoints that can be tested using both Swagger UI and Postman, making it suitable for learning API development and backend architecture.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are to:

- Understand REST API development using FastAPI.
- Implement CRUD operations.
- Learn request validation using Pydantic.
- Organize a project following modular architecture.
- Test APIs using Swagger UI and Postman.
- Build a maintainable backend application.

## Features

- Home endpoint
- About endpoint
- Retrieve all records
- Retrieve a record by ID
- Create new records
- Update existing records
- Delete records
- Automatic interactive API documentation
- Request validation using Pydantic
- JSON request and response handling

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abeer-fatima-dev/AI-Bootcamp-at-PureLogics.git
```

### Navigate to the project directory

```bash
cd Student-Performance-Prediction-App
```

### Create a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

### Activate the virtual environment

**Windows**

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```
